Title: Returns and exchanges go to inventory.

Story
-----
As a store owner,

I want to add items back to inventory when they are returned or exchanged,

so that I can track inventory.

Acceptance Criteria
--------------------
Scenario 1: Items returned for refund should be added to inventory.

Given that a customer previously bought a black sweater from me and I have three black sweaters in inventory,

when they return the black sweater for a refund,

then I should have four black sweaters in inventory.

Scenario 2: Exchanged items should be returned to inventory.

Given that a customer previously bought a blue garment from me and I have two blue garments in inventory and three black garments in inventory,

when they exchange the blue garment for a black garment,

then I should have three blue garments in inventory and two black garments in inventory.
